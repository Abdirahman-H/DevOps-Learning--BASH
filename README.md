# DevOps-Learning--BASH

# Bash Battle Arena – Learning Journey

## 🧠 Summary

This module has been an exciting and hands-on way to deepen my understanding of Bash scripting. Through a game-like format with missions and boss battles, I practiced real-world scripting tasks and gained confidence in using the command line to solve problems.

## 💡 Skills Acquired

- Creating and managing files and directories using Bash
- Writing conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Using loops (`for`, `while`)
- Performing arithmetic in Bash
- Working with command-line tools like `grep`, `find`, `ls`, and `wc`
- Script parameter handling (`$1`, `$2`, etc.)
- Monitoring file and directory changes
- Writing reusable and readable Bash scripts
- Handling backup, sorting, and search operations with automation
- Using `inotifywait` and `cron` basics (if applicable)
- Git and GitHub usage: cloning, committing, pushing code, and writing a README

## 🎯 What I Built

- Level-based Bash scripts to simulate missions
- Scripts to automate file organization, searches, and backups
- Logging and monitoring scripts
- Final “Boss Battle” combining all previous concepts

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Contribute to other Bash-based open-source projects
